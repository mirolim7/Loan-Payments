# Loan-Payments

Here I did a basic analysis on the dataset taken from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/zhijinzhai/loandata

It is an Analysis of Loan Payments Data.

By now, there is an introduction, description, and cleaned and shaped data to do analysis for answering the questions given in the main file.

I did some work for cleaning, shaping data by using numpy and pandas libraries. Additionally I made some visualizations on the data I had using matplotlib and seaborn.

I chose this dataset cause it was recomended to work with for beginners in the Internet, and in process of building my project I liked it, because data clear and understandable.

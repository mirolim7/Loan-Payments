Here I did a basic analysis on the dataset taken from Kaggle:

It is an Analysis of Loan Payments Data.

By now, there is an introduction, description, and cleaned and shaped data to do analysis for answering the questions given in the main file.

I did some work for cleaning, shaping data by using numpy and pandas libraries. Additionally I made some visualizations on the data I had using matplotlib and seaborn.
